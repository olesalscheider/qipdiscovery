QIPDiscovery is a small Qt 5 library that allows you to discover all IPs of the
local computer (including external ones when the network router uses NAT) and
to set up port mappings.
It uses MiniUPnPc to support the UPnP IGD (Internet Gateway Device) protocol.
Support for PCP (Port Control Protocol) is planned but not yet implemented.
